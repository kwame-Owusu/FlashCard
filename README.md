# FlashCard

a flash card created using a combination of tkinter and customtkinter.
using the flash card technique one can learn certain words of a language that they are not quite good at remembering.
for in this case it is just to brush up on my Italian, although i can still speak it fluently ðŸ˜‚

after  3 seconds the card will turn showing the corrispondent word in English we click on the green button to signal that we know the word and red button if we dont know the word
and depending on the words that we know, a csv file containing all the words we dont know will be created, making it easier to know which words we still have trouble learning.
